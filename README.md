# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

This project applies business analytics techniques to predict customer churn using a cleaned Telco dataset.

## üîç Project Overview
This is part of a Master's-level capstone for BAN6800 (Business Analytics Capstone). The particular work is divided into two major phases:

- **Milestone 1**: Data cleaning, preparation, and feature engineering
- **Module 4 Assignment**: Model development, evaluation, and results reporting
